moodle-tool_uploadcourse
========================

Is a Moodle 2.x admin/tools plugin for uploading course outlines
in much the same way that admin/tools/uploaduser works for users.

https://gitorious.org/moodle-tool_uploadcourse

This takes CSV files as input and enables override or augmentation
with default parameter values.

All the usual add,updated,rename, and delete functions.

unpack this archive, and ensure that you have a:
<moodle root>/admin/tools/uploadcourse directory.


Point your browser at Moodle, and login as admin.  This should kick off
the upgrade so that Moodle can now recognise the new plugin.
